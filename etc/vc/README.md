# Virtual Console

Who needs X, right?

These config files are designed to maximize productivity in the Linux virtual
console.

Kept in the dotfile repo mostly so I don't have to re-lookup the capslock
mapping every time I use a fresh Linux.

## Installation

Copy `vconsole.conf` to `/etc`

And copy `personal.map` to `/usr/share/kbd`
