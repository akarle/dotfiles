~akarle's dotfiles

These are MIT-licensed dragons, so hack away!

I'm in a transitionary period where I started fresh in 2022
with a clean-room reimplementation of my old dotfiles (to
relicense them as FOSS), so some areas are a bit in-flux.

That said, starting fresh has been a good excuse to make some
radical changes!

Some mildly-interesting reasons to look inside:

* I'm slowly integrating a plan9-style plumber with tmux(1)

* Configs are tested on OpenBSD and Linux. Most scripts are
  POSIX sh(1) though and should be portable.

* There's an emphasis on small, reusable, and keyboard-driven
  tools.
