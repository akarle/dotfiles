~akarle's dotfiles
------------------
2022, the year of the dotfile rewrite.

This repo's got a _lot_ of history, and I use these configs daily.
In 2022 though, I wanted to start from scratch to both:

  1. License them from the get-go
  2. Re-evaluate what I really use

Dotfiles have a funny way of going stale.  Here's to a fresh start!

Usage:
------
There's really two settings where these are used:

* System administration -- really only need shell / vi / tmux

* Programming -- I need the whole 9 yards for my dayjob.
  Linting, completion, etc

The first is mostly complete (I don't need much), but the second
is a work-in-progress as I retool under a OSI-approved license!
