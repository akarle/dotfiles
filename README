These are MIT-licensed dragons, so hack away!

I'm in a transitionary period where I started fresh in 2022
with a clean-room reimplementation of my old dotfiles (to
relicense them as FOSS), so some areas are a bit in-flux.

That said, starting fresh has been a good excuse to make some
radical changes!

Some mildly-interesting reasons to look inside:

* As of 2022-02, I'm piloting NO_COLOR=1 to see what all the
  hype is about [1]. I'm using acme(1) inspired tones from
  plan9 and go-fonts for fun [2].

* Configs are tested on OpenBSD primarily and Linux for work.
  Most scripts are POSIX sh(1) though and should be portable.

* There's an emphasis on small, reusable, and keyboard-driven
  tools.
