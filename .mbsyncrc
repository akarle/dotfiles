# .mbsyncrc -- local IMAP configuration for Migadu
#
# INSTALL:
#
#    1. Migadu has no "Application Password", but it does
#       have the concept of "identities" that can be
#       locked down to IMAP access with a custom password
#
#    2. Put it in /etc/mail/imap-pass; note that all
#       processes for your user can read this, which
#       isn't ideal, but if hacked, they can also read
#       your email (~/mail) anyways...
#
#        echo "password" | doas tee /etc/mail/imap-pass
#        doas chmod 400 /etc/mail/imap-pass
#        doas chown user:user /etc/mail/imap-pass
#
#    3. Cron it up!
#
#        crontab -e
#        mbsync -a -q -c /path/to/this/file
