# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

## Basic Setup
My vimrc is tailored for Vim 8 and Neovim. I recently migrated to [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for my plugin manager because I am trying to learn some Vimscript and its the simplest and most intuitive out there!

The plugins I am currently rocking are listed below.

## Install

Note that bash is required for this install (as some of the interactive options depend on bash).

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akarle/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
