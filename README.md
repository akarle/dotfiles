# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

# Basic Setup
1. My vimrc is tailored for neovim, get it [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). (NOTE: after installing, read instructions for nvim-from-vim).
2. Set up Vundle for packages [instructions here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
3. I am using the vim-one theme [here](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one), put this in your .vim/colors folder.
4. Run :PluginInstall, and you should be good to go!
5. I am currently using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) for fuzzy file searching.
