dotfiles
========
My personal config files for Linux and OpenBSD.

Installation
------------
The [etc/skel.sh][1] script will bootstrap a minimal config (tmux/sh/git)
that I use on new servers. [etc/install.sh][2] is a more complete
installation for desktop use.

[1]: ./etc/skel.sh
[2]: ./etc/install.sh
