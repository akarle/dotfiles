# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

I found that most of my customization was going to Vim, so I promoted it to its
own repo, [dotvim](https://github.com/akarle/dotvim).

Note that the install will still download it!

## Install

Note that bash is required for this install (as some of the interactive options depend on bash).

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akarle/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
