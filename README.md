dotfiles
========
Vim, tmux, mutt... hope you enjoy the shell!

What follows is my (ongoing) tooling journey. I'm currently on
Linux/OpenBSD both at home and at work, so the support for macOS
and Windows is fleeting at best.

Installation
------------
I'm a big believer in the "do it yourself" style of dotfiles. Fork if you'd
like, but don't blindly copy!

This all said, to set up a new machine I run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/akarle/dotfiles ~/.cfg
$ ./cfg/etc/skel.sh # or install.sh for full install
```
